The conscious mind has very little capacity compared to the deep mind, wherein lie the roots of consciousness and the Creator itself. When you attempt to predetermine how service will unfold, you cut yourself off from the guidance that would naturally lead you. Trust the process. Trust the deeper wisdom that brought you here. Do your daily practice, keep your heart open, and let service find its own form."
