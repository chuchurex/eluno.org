To understand who you are and why you are here, you must understand the history that brought so many different streams of consciousness to this single sphere."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Most planetary populations evolve through the {term:densities} in relative uniformity. The entities of a world progress together, sharing common origins and experiences. Your Earth is different. It is somewhat unusual for a planetary complex to contain those from many, many various places in creation. This explains much about the difficulty your peoples have experienced in achieving unity."},

The orientation of your planet has been difficult to unify even with the aid of many teachers. This is not a flaw but a characteristic of Earth's unique role in this region of the cosmos."},

This world hosted active first, second, and third density life. Its people developed a civilization, built cities, created technology. And then they destroyed themselves utterly."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "The peoples of Maldek had a civilization somewhat similar to that which you call Atlantis. They gained much technological information and used it without care for the preservation of their sphere. They followed, to a majority extent, patterns of thought and action associated with the negative polarity—{term:service-to-self}. Yet this was, for the most part, couched in a sincere belief that seemed to them positive and of service to others. {ref:myth:plato-atlantis}"},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "This is a crucial point. The entities of Maldek did not consider themselves evil. They believed they were doing good. The devastation that wracked their biosphere and caused its disintegration resulted from what you call war. The escalation went to the furthest extent of the technology their social complex had at its disposal. This occurred approximately 705,000 of your years ago."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "When a planet is destroyed, it is not merely a physical catastrophe. It is a spiritual one. None escaped. In the case of planetary dissolution, this action reverberates into the social complex of the planetary complex itself. Every entity was caught in what might be called a knot—a tangle of fear so profound that they could not be reached by any being. For approximately 100,000 years, members of the {term:confederation} repeatedly attempted to aid them and failed."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Approximately 600,000 years ago, a Confederation {term:social-memory-complex} was finally able to begin relaxing this knot of fear. The entities were then transformed into the inner dimensions and underwent a lengthy process of healing. When this was accomplished, they were able to determine the appropriate movement to relieve the consequences of their actions."},

They took second-density physical vehicles—bodies incapable of the manipulation and dexterity appropriate for third-density work. Their consciousness remained at third density, but their bodies could not fully express it."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "This transfer began approximately 500,000 years ago. {ref:phil:technology-ethics} Some of these entities have since relieved their karma and have moved into third-density bodies, many incarnating elsewhere in creation. A few remained on Earth and joined your third-density experience when your planet reached that stage. And some remain still in second-density form—those whom your peoples have glimpsed and called by various names, including Bigfoot."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "The lesson of Maldek echoes through your solar system's history: the sincere belief that one serves others while actually serving self can lead to catastrophe.

Its third-density population was attempting to learn the lessons of love—one of the primal {term:distortion}s of unity. However, the tendencies of these people toward bellicose actions caused such difficulties in the atmospheric environment of their planet that it became inhospitable for third-density experience before the end of its cycle."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Unlike Maldek, Mars was not destroyed. But its atmosphere was rendered uninhabitable due to the cumulative effects of war and conflict. The entities of Mars faced a situation where they could not complete their cycle on their home world. They were, in a sense, refugees—not from political circumstances but from spiritual consequences."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Approximately 75,000 years ago, at the beginning of Earth's third-density cycle, those known as the {term:guardians} made a decision. The genetic material of the Mars population was preserved, adjusted through a careful series of modifications, and transferred to Earth through a type of birthing which was not reproductive—what might be understood as a form of cloning. The {term:mind-body-spirit} complexes of Mars entities were thus able to incarnate on Earth in bodies prepared for them."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "The genetic adjustments made had a purpose: to express characteristics that would lead to a more rapid and profound development of the spiritual complex. The physical senses were sharpened to intensify experience. The mental complex was strengthened to promote the ability to analyze these experiences. These modifications were made with the intention of aiding evolution."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "However, this transfer was seen by other Guardians as an infringement upon {term:free-will}. The entities of Mars had not chosen Earth; they were placed here. Their genetic material was modified without their conscious participation. From this beginning action, the {term:quarantine} of your planet was instituted."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "The quarantine is not a punishment but a protection. It prevents interference from entities of other densities except under specific circumstances. It ensures that the population of Earth, however mixed in origin, must work out its own destiny through the exercise of free will. The Guardians watch, but they do not directly intervene unless certain conditions are met."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Thus began Earth's 75,000-year {term:master-cycle} of third density. The first entities to experience it in human form were those from Mars—carrying with them the unfinished lessons of love, the tendencies toward conflict that had destroyed the habitability of their world, and a new opportunity to choose differently."}

        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "In the earliest creations of this octave, there was no forgetting. The first mind/body/spirit beings were not complexes in the way that you are. They experienced third density while retaining full awareness of who they were, where they came from, and the nature of the universe. They could see that all was One. They understood the purpose of their existence."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "The result was problematic. These non-veiled entities progressed along the path of spiritual evolution very slowly. The unveiled condition did not conduce to {term:polarization}. When you can see clearly that all is One, that service to others is literally service to self, where is the challenge? Where is the genuine decision? The choice becomes obvious, almost automatic, and therefore lacks transformative power."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "The veiling was an experiment introduced by later {term:logos} entities. It proved so effective at increasing polarization that it was adopted by all subsequent sub-Logos. Your sun, the Logos of this solar system, employs the veil. Earth's third density operates under this condition of forgetting."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "When the forgetting has occurred, the emotional, mental, and physical experiences of an entity are sharpened to a degree beyond imagination. Compared to the later densities, third density becomes a marvelous and exciting place where experiences are vividly beautiful and exponentially more powerful. The stakes feel real because you do not remember that you are eternal. The choices feel consequential because you cannot see their ultimate outcomes."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "You dwell in the darkness of unknowing. You must rely upon your biases, your thoughts, your dreams, and whatever connection you have been able to make to the deep mind. You spend third-density time deciding how to love. What a great decision. What a fundamental decision. And for it, the veil is necessary."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "This is the condition under which all of the history we shall now describe has unfolded. Every civilization, every conflict, every spiritual achievement and failure on Earth has occurred behind the veil. The entities involved did not remember their cosmic origins. They did not see the unity underlying their apparent separation. They had to choose—and their choices, made in darkness, carry weight that choices made in full knowledge cannot possess."}

        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "At that time, the life-span of incarnate entities was approximately 900 years. The population was mixed from the beginning: entities from Mars in their new genetic vehicles, some entities from Maldek who had healed enough to join third-density experience, and beings who had graduated from Earth's own second density—the higher animals and plants that had evolved on this world."},

Its people were beings of a somewhat primitive nature in terms of technology, but they possessed very advanced spiritual {term:distortion}s. They were not sophisticated in the ways of material manipulation but were closely in touch with the consciousness of all life."},

These particular entities were largely from a second-density planet in the area you know as the Deneb galaxy. Their home world had difficulty achieving third-density life conditions due to the age of their sun. They came to Earth seeking the opportunity their own planet could not provide."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Lemuria was a helpful and harmless place. Its people lived in relative harmony, not because they were more virtuous than others, but because their orientation was naturally toward the spiritual rather than the material. They did not develop the technologies that could become weapons. They did not accumulate the kind of power that corrupts."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Approximately 50,000 years ago, Lemuria was destroyed—not through any action of their own, but by natural catastrophe. The land mass was washed beneath the ocean during a readjustment of the tectonic plates of your sphere. This destruction coincided with the end of the first major cycle, a time when there is always a confluence of energies that can sponsor planetary changes."},

        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "In the sense of technological grandeur, there were no great societies during this cycle. The pattern of Lemuria—spiritual advancement without material sophistication—did not repeat itself in any concentrated form. Instead, progress occurred in pockets, in various peoples working independently toward the activation of higher energy centers."},

There were positive steps in activating the green-ray energy complex—the heart center, the center of love—in many portions of your planetary sphere. This occurred in the Americas, in the continent you call Africa, in the island you call Australia, and in what you know as India, as well as among various scattered peoples."},

We were a more philosophical people; they were not."},

You carry the karma of multiple worlds, multiple civilizations, multiple experiments in consciousness. This makes unity difficult. But it also means that your planet, if it can achieve unity, will have integrated lessons from across the galaxy. The prize is worth the effort."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Fourth: the veil of forgetting, while it creates confusion, also creates opportunity. Your choices, made without memory of who you truly are, carry weight that choices made in full knowledge cannot possess. This is the gift of third density, the precious nature of this brief and intense experience. Do not waste it wishing you could see more clearly. Use the very darkness as catalyst for faith, for seeking, for choosing."},

The history we have described led to this moment. What comes after depends on you—on each of you, individually, making choices that accumulate into collective destiny."},
