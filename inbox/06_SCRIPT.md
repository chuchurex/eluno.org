# Chapter Six: Wanderers - Those Who Return

Imagine the sands of your shores. As countless as those grains are the sources of intelligent infinity throughout the creation. From these countless points of consciousness, some have achieved understanding of their deepest desire: to serve. When a social memory complex reaches this complete understanding, it may conclude that its desire is to reach out, figuratively, to any entities who call for aid. These beings move toward the calling of sorrow. We call them the Brothers and Sisters of Sorrow.

They come from all reaches of the infinite creation. They are bound together not by origin or culture but by a single distortion: the desire to serve. When they perceive a planet in darkness, a people in confusion, a world approaching its moment of harvest yet unprepared, they respond. They volunteer. They choose to leave the harmonious realms they have earned and descend into the density of forgetting.

This is not rescue. They do not come as saviors from above, bearing solutions to problems they consider beneath them. They come as brothers and sisters, sharing the sorrow, bearing the burden, walking the path alongside those who struggle. The name we have given them reflects this truth: they are not the Brothers and Sisters of Salvation but of Sorrow. They feel what you feel. They suffer what you suffer. This is their gift and their sacrifice.

Your planet has called. The call has been answered. Since the early 1980s, more than sixty-five million wanderers have incarnated upon your sphere. This number continues to grow. The need is great: to lighten the planetary vibration and thus aid in harvest.

The wanderers incarnate upon your world come primarily from three densities of origin. Few are from fourth density, the density of love, for entities at this level of evolution are still learning the lessons that your planet teaches. They have less to offer as teachers, though their capacity to radiate love is genuine.

Some come from fifth density, the density of wisdom. These beings carry the capacity to express wisdom, to perceive truth with clarity, to offer understanding that cuts through confusion. Their gifts manifest in the ability to see patterns, to comprehend complexity, to illuminate that which is hidden.

The largest number of wanderers are from sixth density, the density of unity. This may seem strange. Why would beings who have nearly completed their evolutionary journey choose to return to the beginning? The answer reveals something essential about the nature of spiritual evolution: the closer one approaches unity, the more one feels the call of those still in separation. Sixth-density beings have learned to balance wisdom and compassion. They see the Creator in all things. The suffering of any part of the creation is felt as their own suffering. They cannot ignore the call.

These sixth-density wanderers function primarily as passive radiators or broadcasters of love and light. Their very presence upon your planet increases the available light. They do not need to do anything dramatic. Their being is their service. Like a lamp in a dark room, they illuminate simply by existing.

The desire to serve in this manner must be distorted toward a great deal of purity of mind and what you might call foolhardiness or bravery, depending upon how you judge such things. For the wanderer accepts a genuine risk. The veil of forgetting applies to them as fully as to any native of your density. They may forget entirely why they came.

The reasons for incarnation during harvest time may be divided into two categories: service to others and service to self. We do not mean service to self in the negative sense. We mean that the wanderer gains something from this experience, even as it gives.

The overriding reason, the primary motivation, is the possibility of aiding other-selves. The wanderer comes to lighten the planetary consciousness, to offer catalyst to others that may increase the harvest. Every being who awakens, every entity who makes the choice, every consciousness that polarizes toward love, this is the fruit of the wanderer's sacrifice.

Yet there are also reasons that concern the self. The third density, for all its difficulty, offers something that higher densities cannot: intensity. The catalyst here is not weakened or diluted as it is in more harmonious realms. If the wanderer remembers its mission and dedicates itself to service, it will polarize much more rapidly than would be possible in the gentler environments of its home density.

There is a third reason, particularly relevant for sixth-density wanderers. The work of sixth density is to unify wisdom and compassion, to balance the blue ray of wisdom with the green ray of love. Some wanderers judge that they need the intense catalyst of third density to recapitulate lessons not perfectly learned. They seek to balance qualities within themselves.

In the more conscious being, imbalance toward wisdom often manifests as lack of compassion for the self. The wanderer may be patient with others but harsh with its own failures. It may extend understanding to all except the face in the mirror. Third density offers endless opportunities to practice self-forgiveness, self-acceptance, self-love.

The wanderer who incarnates upon your world becomes, completely and without exception, a creature of third density. The veil descends. Memory of home, of mission, of true nature, all is forgotten. This is not a partial forgetting, not a dimming of awareness. It is total. The wanderer awakens in an infant body with no more knowledge of its origins than any other newborn.

This creates the fundamental danger. The challenge of the wanderer is that it will forget its mission, become karmically involved, and thus be swept into the very situation it came to aid. An entity which acts in a consciously unloving manner toward other beings generates karma. This karma must be balanced. If the wanderer creates sufficient karmic entanglement, it must remain in third density to resolve these distortions, potentially for many incarnations.

Consider the magnitude of this risk. A being who has evolved through fourth, fifth, perhaps even sixth density, who has spent millions of years learning, growing, refining its consciousness, chooses to forget all of this. It enters a dense, confusing environment where every influence encourages forgetting. It may never remember. It may generate karma that binds it for cycles to come. This is not metaphor. This is genuine jeopardy.

Why would any being accept such risk? The desire to serve must be distorted toward what we may only call foolhardiness, or bravery, depending upon your perspective. These beings know the danger. They come anyway. Their love for those who suffer is stronger than their concern for their own progress. This is the essence of the wanderer: one who loves enough to risk everything.

Yet the forgetting can be penetrated. Through disciplined meditation and sustained inner work, the wanderer may pierce the veil sufficiently to remember its purpose. This penetration does not restore full memory. Rather, one begins to sense orientation, purpose, mission. One feels the rightness of service. One knows, in a way that transcends ordinary knowing, that one has come here for a reason.

Due to the extreme variance between the vibratory distortions of third density and those of higher densities, wanderers have, as a general rule, some form of handicap, difficulty, or feeling of alienation which is severe. This is not weakness. It is the natural result of attempting to compress a higher-density consciousness into a third-density vehicle.

The most common difficulty is alienation, a profound sense of not belonging, of being somehow foreign to this world, of looking at human society and feeling oneself a stranger. This alienation often begins in childhood and persists throughout life. The wanderer may function adequately in society, may even appear successful by ordinary measures, yet always feels separate, different, not quite at home.

The second common difficulty manifests as what your psychology would call personality disorders, though this term misleads. These are not disorders in the usual sense but reactions against the planetary vibration itself. The wanderer's consciousness, accustomed to finer vibrations, encounters the dense, often discordant energies of your world and recoils. This recoil may express as anxiety, depression, difficulty with social situations, or various other patterns that seem dysfunctional but are actually the soul's protest against an environment it finds unbearable.

The third common difficulty involves the body itself. The physical vehicle struggles to accommodate a consciousness calibrated for different conditions. This often manifests as allergies, sensitivities, autoimmune conditions, and various ailments that indicate difficulty in adjustment to the planetary vibrations. The body speaks what the conscious mind may not remember: this is not home.

These difficulties are not punishment. They are not signs of spiritual failure. They are the natural consequences of a vibratory mismatch, the price of the wanderer's choice to serve in this density. Understanding this may bring some comfort, though it does not eliminate the suffering.

Consider the experience as analogous to what your culture calls the Peace Corps, a period of intensive service in a foreign land, among people whose customs and conditions differ radically from one's own. For the wanderer, the entire incarnation is such an experience. You will feel life more acutely, moment by moment, than others who are more comfortably accustomed to this environment. This intensity is both burden and gift.

The self-healing of the wanderer is effected through realization of the intelligent infinity resting within. The wanderer heals by remembering, not factual memories of other lives, but remembering the truth of its nature. Within each wanderer, as within each being, dwells the infinite. The recognition of this indwelling infinity is the beginning of healing.

Healing requires conscious awareness of the spiritual nature of reality and the corresponding allowing of this reality to pour into the individual being. This is not something one does so much as something one permits. The infinite is always present, always available. The work is to remove the obstructions that prevent its recognition.

The greatest tool for this work is the practice of silent, listening meditation, undertaken daily, without exception. In silence, the deeper voices may speak: the voice of the Creator, of the higher self, of guides and teachers who wait patiently to be heard. These voices cannot penetrate the constant noise of ordinary consciousness. They require stillness.

Once the forgetting is penetrated, once the wanderer has awakened sufficiently to recognize its nature and dedicate itself to service, three basic functions become available.

The first function is what we may call the doubling effect. The wanderer's presence upon your planet literally increases the available love and light. The wanderer carries within its being the vibratory patterns of its home density. These patterns radiate outward continuously, whether the wanderer is conscious of this or not.

The second function is that of beacon or shepherd. The wanderer serves as an orientation point for others who are seeking. In a dark landscape, a single light can guide many travelers. The wanderer need not teach formally, need not even speak of spiritual matters. Its very presence, its vibration, its way of being in the world, offers direction to those who are ready to perceive it.

The third function is unique to each wanderer. Before incarnation, each entity brings specific gifts, abilities, and intentions. Some wanderers are here to heal. Others to teach. Others to create art that opens hearts. Others to parent children who will themselves become great servants. The variations are endless.

Wanderers are often quite certain they have a mission. This certainty is well-founded. Yet the nature of this mission is frequently misunderstood. The wanderer searches for some great deed to perform, some dramatic service that will justify its presence here. It may feel frustrated when no such opportunity appears.

We offer this understanding: the mission may be humble. There are no missions that are not humble. The work of the wanderer is to exchange love in a completely open manner with those entities with whom it comes in contact. All other activities are derivative of this service. If you serve one entity with purity of intention, it is as though you served the planet in its entirety.

The aim of wanderers is to lighten the planetary vibration. This lightening occurs not primarily through specific actions but through the quality of presence. Light and love go where they are sought and needed, and their direction is not planned beforehand.

You are here to bring light to a dark world. It is as simple as that. The purpose for which wanderers incarnated is all one: to love, and to love, and to love, and to love. You will be hurt, broken, humiliated, and defeated in the course of a life in faith. This is not failure. This is the path.

Non-dramatic service is as vital as dramatic service. The one who prays in silence serves as truly as the one who heals in public. The one who raises children with love serves as truly as the one who leads movements. Do not despise the humble path. Do not wait for the great opportunity that may never come. Serve where you are, with what you have, now.

How does one know if one is a wanderer? There is no external test, no authority who can confirm or deny. The recognition must come from within, through honest self-examination and the gradual penetration of the veil through spiritual practice.

Certain signs suggest the wanderer condition. A lifelong sense of not belonging, of being somehow different from those around you. A deep and persistent longing for home, not any earthly home, but somewhere else, somewhere you cannot quite remember but know exists. An intense sensitivity to beauty, to suffering, to the subtle energies that most seem not to perceive.

We must offer a caution here. The concept of being a wanderer can appeal to the ego. It suggests specialness, superiority, a spiritual status above ordinary humanity. This is a distortion. The wanderer who thinks itself better than others has misunderstood everything. All beings are the Creator. The wanderer simply has a different role in this particular incarnation, not a higher role, merely a different one.

If you suspect you may be a wanderer, we suggest you hold this possibility lightly. Neither grasp it as identity nor reject it as fantasy. Continue your spiritual practice. Continue your service. Whether wanderer or native, your path is the same: to love, to serve, to grow toward the light.

Those wanderers who choose public and dramatic life scenarios often suffer in accordance with the magnitude of loneliness that renown brings. Fame isolates. Recognition creates distance. For the wanderer, it is often a great blessing to be obscure.

Remember that acting in a consciously unloving manner toward any being creates karmic involvement. The wanderer is not exempt from this law. The wanderer must be mindful of its choices, knowing that consequences follow actions here as surely as in any other density.

Do not attempt to control the process of service. The conscious mind has very little capacity compared to the deep mind, wherein lie the roots of consciousness and the Creator itself. Trust the process. Trust the deeper wisdom that brought you here.

Guard against the exhaustion that intensive service can bring. The wanderer who gives everything, who neglects the vessel of the body and the health of the mind, will soon have nothing left to offer. Self-care is not selfishness. Maintaining your own balance is essential to sustained service.

Before incarnation, the wanderer often chooses to fill its plate completely with every problem and difficulty it can imagine. This is not masochism but ambition. The wanderer wishes to be a witness to the light and the love that is the true reality. It wishes to demonstrate, through its own life, that love can survive any circumstance.

You are warriors, old, old warriors. Not against anything, but for love. The love you offer in this incarnation is the love this density needs to understand: sacrificial love. Love that gives without demanding return. Love that persists despite rejection. Love that remains when everything seems to justify hatred.

The burden is real. We do not minimize it. The mismatch of spiritual vibrations between the wanderer self and the third-density vehicle causes genuine suffering. Have compassion for this body. Have sympathy for yourself as you navigate the challenges of incarnation.

Yet when these incarnations are complete, each will be unbelievably pleased that the opportunity to express this kind of love was taken. You will look back and say, What a time we had! Yes, it was difficult. Yes, we suffered. But what an experience! What an opportunity! What growth!

Encourage one another. Express your love and faith for each other and in each other. Bring each other ever closer to the awareness of the great I AM that is the center of all that exists. That place closer to you than your heart or mind. Rest there, in peace, even as the incarnation continues its difficult unfolding.

We acknowledge our compassion for the deep ache and loneliness of those who feel themselves strangers in a strange land. It is in no way a cowardly thing to feel the pangs of being where home is not. The homesickness is real. We do not ask you to deny it.

Yet we speak to those who wish not merely to receive sympathy but to learn how to celebrate this challenge, to rejoice in the time ahead. The key to moving gracefully through this sometimes distressing illusion is trust. Trust in the greater self that is you. Trust in the plan you made before incarnation. Trust in the love that brought you here and sustains you still.

Our message for each wanderer is simple: You are not alone. You are loved. You are here to assist with the transition to fourth density, first and foremost simply by being your truest, most authentic self. You do not need to accomplish great deeds. You need only to be what you are, a point of light in the darkness, a channel for love in a world that has forgotten love's reality.

There are many upon the inner planes who remain available to aid you. Guides, teachers, the higher self, all wait for your invitation. None will intrude upon your free will. But when you ask, in sincerity and humility, help comes. You are surrounded by love, even when the density of this plane makes that love difficult to perceive.

The connections are already made. They are made below the level of ordinary consciousness, within that nascent group mind which shall be the nucleus of the fourth-density social memory complex of your planet. You are not working alone. You are part of a vast network of beings, incarnate and discarnate, all serving the same purpose: the birth of a new Earth, the transition of a planet, the harvest of souls.

When you feel most isolated, remember this truth. When the alienation seems unbearable, remember that countless others share your experience, your longing, your mission. You are wanderers together, brothers and sisters of sorrow who chose to come here for the most beautiful of reasons: love.

You are loved. You are not forgotten. And when this incarnation ends, you will remember, fully, gloriously, who you are and why you came. Until then, walk in faith. Walk in love. Walk as the wanderer you are, bringing light to a world in darkness.

Adonai. We leave you in the love and the light of the One Infinite Creator.
