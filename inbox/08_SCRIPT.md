# Chapter Eight: The Veil of Forgetting

You who read these words dwell in darkness. Not the darkness of evil, but the darkness of unknowing, a forgetting so complete that you cannot remember who you are, where you came from, or why you are here. This is not an accident. This is not a punishment. This is a gift, though it may not feel like one. The veil of forgetting is the defining feature of your experience, the very condition that makes third density what it is.

This veil separates your conscious awareness from the deeper portions of your mind. It hides from you the unity that underlies all things. It prevents you from seeing that you are the Creator experiencing itself, that the stranger before you is yourself in another form, that all the separation you perceive is illusion. The forgetting is radical, complete, and applies equally to all who incarnate in your density.

Yet the veil has not always existed. It was introduced as an experiment by early sub-Logos entities, the great beings that create the conditions for evolution within portions of the creation. The experiment proved so remarkably effective at accelerating spiritual evolution that it was adopted by all subsequent sub-Logoi. Your sun, the Logos of this solar system, employs the veil.

To understand why the veil exists and what it accomplishes, we must examine what third density was like before its introduction.

In the earliest creations of this octave, third-density beings experienced existence without the veil. They retained full awareness of who they were, where they came from, and the nature of the universe. They could see that all was One. They understood the purpose of their existence.

This may sound like paradise. It was not. These non-veiled entities progressed along the path of spiritual evolution with the pace of the turtle to the cheetah when compared to veiled experience. The non-veiled condition was simply not conducive to polarization. When you can see clearly that all is One, that service to others is literally service to self, where is the challenge? The choice becomes obvious, almost automatic, and therefore lacks transformative power.

Consider the third-density entities in these early experiments. They could control their bodies at will, adjusting blood pressure, heart rate, the intensity of pain. They could turn off nerve receptors that signaled distress. Pain served only as a warning, and once the warning was received, the discomfort could be eliminated by simple mental decision.

Dreams served a different function in this unshaded awareness. Without the veil, dreams were not windows to the unconscious, there was no unconscious to peer into. Instead, dreams provided opportunities for direct instruction from teachers of other densities.

Sexual energy transfer occurred with every coupling, for there was no shadow upon the understanding of the body's nature. Yet these transfers were attenuated, weakened by the very clarity that enabled them. When you can see that every other-self is the Creator, where is the motivation for the deep bonding that transforms sexual connection into sacrament?

The higher self stood openly with the incarnate entity, its guidance immediate and obvious. No faith was required. No seeking was necessary. And precisely because no faith was required, no faith developed. The muscle of seeking remained weak from disuse.

How does one veil consciousness from itself? The mechanism is both simple in concept and profound in implication. The veil operates as a separation between the conscious and unconscious portions of the mind. Before this separation, the mind was unitary. The introduction of the veil created a declaration that the mind was complex, consisting of parts that could not directly perceive each other.

This fundamental division in the mind caused a corresponding complexity in the body and spirit. What had been mind, body, and spirit became the mind-body-spirit complex, three interrelated aspects, each with conscious and unconscious dimensions, each capable of independent development, each requiring integration.

The veiling process was not designed with specific features. The first great experiment rested upon the nakedness of hypothesis. Through trial and error, what might be called cosmic experimentation, various configurations were tested. Eventually, a workable configuration emerged: the veiled consciousness you now inhabit.

The most significant effect of veiling was upon the mind. Almost all facets of the Creator were buried beneath the veil. The conscious mind found itself isolated from the great depths of awareness that had previously been its natural domain. It lost access to what might be called the roots of mind: the racial mind, the planetary mind, the archetypal mind, the cosmic mind.

Several faculties were particularly affected. First was the faculty of visioning, the ability to see beyond the immediate moment into possibilities and probabilities. Second was dreaming, which transformed from a classroom into a communication channel between the veiled conscious mind and the hidden depths. Third was knowledge of the body, its potentials, its functions, its capacities, all buried beneath the veil.

Perhaps the most important product of the veiling was not a function of the mind but a faculty that emerged from the new conditions: the faculty of will, or pure desire. When all is known, desire is weak. When much is hidden, desire becomes a force of evolution.

The veiling process removed conscious access to many aspects of existence that non-veiled entities took for granted.

Knowledge of the body's potentials was lost. Before the veil, entities could direct all physical functions. This knowledge was veiled in a particular configuration that proved viable for third-density functioning.

The loss of bodily knowledge created something unexpected: desire. When the potentials and functions of the physical vehicle are shrouded from awareness, the entity is often nearly without knowledge of how to best manifest its being. This state of lack offers an opportunity for desire to grow within the mind complex, the desire to know the possibilities of the body.

Contact with the higher self was altered fundamentally. After the veil, the higher self became a single door against which it must stand awaiting entry. The higher self cannot cross the threshold uninvited. It must wait for the incarnate entity to seek, to call, to open.

Dreams lost their direct instructional function. They became instead communications through the veil, messages from the unconscious to the conscious mind, often muddied and quickly lost upon waking.

Sexual energy transfer was affected profoundly. After the veil, it became infinitely more difficult to achieve the green-ray energy transfer that opens higher possibilities, but when such transfer was achieved, it was far more likely to catalyze genuine bonding and polarization. Mystery made intimacy significant.

The veiling process, despite its appearance as loss, was designed to increase free will. This may seem paradoxical: how does hiding truth from consciousness expand freedom?

Before the veil, non-veiled entities were seen as not having free will in the fuller sense. When the right choice is obvious, when the nature of reality is apparent, where is the freedom? Choice becomes reflexive rather than decisive. The veiling so extended free will that non-veiled entities appeared to have none by comparison.

When the forgetting has occurred, the emotional, mental, and physical experiences of an entity are sharpened to a degree beyond imagination. Compared to later densities, third density becomes a marvelous and exciting place where experiences are vividly beautiful and exponentially more powerful. The stakes feel real because you do not remember that you are eternal.

The Choice became possible in a way it had not been before. The veiling created the conditions for genuine polarization. When you cannot see that all is One, when the negative path appears viable and even attractive, then choosing the positive path means something. The choice is forged in fire rather than selected from a menu.

The purpose of polarity is to develop the potential to do work. Work is done far more efficiently, with greater purity, intensity, and variety, by the voluntary searching of consciousness for the lessons of third density. Those who choose in darkness, by faith alone, develop a polarization that cannot be achieved in full light.

You dwell in the valley of decision. In the darkness of unknowing, in honest uncertainty, depending upon your biases, your thoughts, your dreams, and whatever connection you have been able to make to the deeper mind, you spend third-density time deciding how to love. What a great decision. And for it, the veil is necessary.

The veil is not a wall but a curtain. It is semi-permeable, designed to be worked with rather than simply endured. The progressive lifting of the veil is third-density work.

No methods of veil penetration were planned by the first experimenters. It was discovered experientially that there were as many ways to penetrate the veil as the imagination could provide. The desire of consciousness to know that which was unknown drew to it the methods of discovery.

Dreaming became a primary channel. When properly attended to, dreams offer clues to the nature of energy center blockages, hints at changes in perception that may lead to unblocking. The seeker may train in the discipline of recording dreams immediately upon awakening.

The various unmanifested activities of the self, meditation, contemplation, internal balancing of thoughts and reactions, were found productive of veil penetration. In meditation, consciousness moves into the deeper mind as a lover to the beloved, seeking not to force entry but to woo and win.

By far the most vivid opportunities for piercing the veil arise from the interaction of polarized entities. Those of like mind who together seek shall far more surely find. The other-self is primary catalyst in the path to piercing the veil.

The penetration of the veil may be seen to begin in the gestation of green-ray activity, that all-compassionate love which demands no return. If this path is followed, the higher energy centers shall be activated and crystallized until the adept is born. Within the adept is the potential for dismantling the veil to a greater or lesser extent, that all may be seen again as One.

There are shortcuts that carry risk. Mind-altering substances, extended fasting, rhythmic dancing, these can shatter the veil briefly. But when the veil is breached artificially without preparation, the situation becomes random and potentially harmful. The universe lies within you, not all of it is gentle.

The veil creates the conditions in which faith becomes necessary and therefore becomes possible. Before the veil, faith was not required, the truth was evident. After the veil, faith becomes the bridge across the darkness of unknowing.

Faith is not belief without evidence. It is trust in the face of uncertainty, commitment without guarantee, love offered in darkness. The entity veiled from the truth of its own nature must choose whether to trust that nature or to fear it.

The seeker who cultivates faith develops a capacity that will serve throughout all densities to come. Faith built in darkness has a strength that faith built in light cannot possess. It has been tested. It represents genuine commitment rather than mere acknowledgment of the obvious.

This is why the forgetting is a gift. It creates the conditions for the development of faith, will, and desire, faculties that remain underdeveloped in non-veiled existence. The entity who learns to love without seeing, to serve without certainty, to choose without proof, develops capacities that enrich the entire creation.

We do not suggest that you welcome suffering. We suggest that you recognize the veil for what it is: a condition designed to potentiate your evolution. The forgetting is not your enemy. It is the darkness against which your light may shine, the mystery into which your seeking may extend.

Regular meditation serves this purpose well. In the stillness, you contact depths of self that the busy surface mind cannot reach. You align with the intelligent infinity that underlies all things. Each time you choose to sit in silence, seeking the unknown, you exercise the faculty of faith and strengthen it.

The veil of forgetting is neither accident nor punishment. It is a carefully developed condition that serves the evolution of consciousness in ways that full awareness cannot match. You who experience the forgetting are participants in one of the most effective experiments in the history of creation.

The darkness of your unknowing is rich with purpose. In it, you make choices that matter. In it, you develop faith, will, and desire. In it, you learn to love without seeing, to serve without certainty, to trust without proof. These capacities, forged in the fire of veiled experience, become permanent features of your consciousness.

The veil will lift. In fourth density, no thought is hidden. The unity underlying separation becomes visible. When you cross the threshold of harvest, you will remember, fully, gloriously, who you are and why you came. And you will understand, perhaps with gratitude, the gift that was given when that knowledge was hidden.

Until then, you walk in the valley of the shadow. You seek through the curtain. You reach toward the light you cannot yet see but somehow know is there. This seeking is not failure. It is precisely the work of third density. The journey is through the veil, not around it, through the darkness and into what lies beyond.

The journey continues. For now, you have the darkness. You have the choice. You have the faith that reaches through the veil toward love. Use what you have been given. The forgetting is not forever, but its gifts are eternal.
