# Chapter Nine: Death and the Journey Between Lives

We have spoken of the veil, that curtain of forgetting which separates the conscious mind from its deeper knowing. This veil operates throughout your incarnation, shaping every experience, every choice. But what happens when the incarnation ends? What occurs when the physical body can no longer sustain the consciousness that has animated it?

Death is not what most of your peoples imagine it to be. It is neither an ending nor a beginning in the absolute sense. It is a transition, a crossing from one mode of existence to another. The consciousness that you are does not cease. It cannot cease, for consciousness is the fundamental reality from which all else springs. What ceases is the particular vehicle, the yellow-ray body, through which you have been experiencing this density.

Understanding what follows death may seem abstract, perhaps even irrelevant to the concerns of daily life. Yet this understanding carries profound practical value. When you know what awaits, you can live differently. The fear that surrounds death loses much of its power.

When the physical body can no longer sustain life, something remarkable occurs. There is no break in consciousness, no void, no gap, no cessation of awareness. The entity simply shifts from one vehicle to another. The yellow-ray body returns to potentiation. In its place, the indigo-ray body activates.

This indigo body is sometimes called the form-maker or the etheric body. It is the first body to activate upon what you call death. Unlike the dense physical vehicle you now inhabit, this body is composed of what might be called intelligent energy in microcosm. It is capable of shaping form according to consciousness, of molding itself as the entity desires.

The transition itself is often experienced as movement toward light. Many of your peoples who have approached death and returned describe this phenomenon. They speak of tunnels of light, of warmth and welcome, of being drawn toward something ineffably beautiful. These experiences, while filtered through the expectations and beliefs of the individual, reflect a genuine metaphysical reality.

Upon realizing its state, the entity returns to this indigo form-maker body and rests therein. This realization may come immediately or may take what seems like time, depending upon the entity's preparation and awareness.

Not all entities complete this transition smoothly. In some cases, the will remains so focused upon the physical experience that the entity cannot fully release its attachment to the yellow-ray existence. This creates what you might call an earthbound spirit, a consciousness that lingers between modes of being.

This occurs not as punishment but as consequence. The will is a powerful thing. When an entity has concentrated its entire focus upon some aspect of physical experience, whether possessions, relationships, unfinished tasks, or intense emotional states, that concentration may persist beyond the body's death.

Consider the soldier who dies suddenly in battle, consciousness still engaged in combat. Consider the miser whose entire identity has become entangled with accumulated wealth. Consider the lover who cannot release the object of obsessive attachment. In each case, the will creates a kind of anchor.

This condition is temporary. Eventually, all entities find their way forward. Helpers in the metaphysical planes work with such entities, offering the love and light necessary for release.

For the living, this understanding offers guidance. The practice of releasing attachment is not merely philosophical exercise. It is preparation for transition. The entity who has learned to hold things lightly will transition smoothly when the time comes.

To understand what follows death, one must understand the nature of embodiment itself. You are not simply a physical body with a spirit attached. You are a complex of seven bodies, each corresponding to one of the seven densities of consciousness.

The red-ray body is the most basic, the unconstructed material. The orange-ray body is the physical form that develops in the womb before the spirit enters. The yellow-ray body is your current vehicle.

Beyond these are the subtler bodies. The green-ray body is packed more densely with life force, lighter than the physical, sometimes called the astral body. The blue-ray body is lighter still, a body of pure light. The indigo-ray body is the form-maker, the gateway body.

Finally, there is the violet-ray body, the complete body, sometimes called the Buddha body. This represents the totality of the being. During the harvest, it is this body that manifests to determine graduation.

When you leave the physical body, you enter what we call time-space, the metaphysical counterpart to the space-time you currently experience.

In your current experience, space provides the framework of reality. You can move freely through space but you cannot move freely through time. Time flows in one direction at one speed.

In time-space, this relationship inverts. Space becomes the fixed dimension while time becomes fluid. The entity can review experiences from any point in the incarnation, revisiting moments, examining them from new angles. Past, present, and future lose their rigid separation.

This is why much can be accomplished between incarnations. The review of an incarnation is not rushed. The healing of wounds is not abbreviated. What might seem like moments in space-time can correspond to vast periods of processing in time-space.

Each incarnation is a course in the Creator knowing Itself. And like any course, it includes a review, not an examination by some external authority, but a thorough revisiting of what was learned and what was missed.

In time-space, the entity reviews and re-reviews the biases and teachings of the prior incarnation. Every significant moment can be revisited. Every choice can be examined not only from your own perspective but from the perspective of all others involved. The pain you caused becomes visible in its full impact. The love you gave reveals its true reach.

This review is not punishment, though it may be humbling. It is not judgment, though it brings clarity. Each portion of the Creator reviews its own experience, integrating what was lived in the density of forgetting.

The wise seeker does not wait until death to review the incarnation. A daily practice of honest reflection, examining the day's experiences, noting the moments of love and the moments of fear, this practice mirrors what will occur after death.

Where there has been harm, there is need for healing. This principle operates between incarnations as surely as within them.

The form-maker body and the Higher Self work together to place the entity in the proper configuration for this healing. Just as a broken bone must be set correctly to mend, the dislocations of consciousness must be properly arranged for the healing energies to work effectively.

The healing process penetrates deeply. Much can be addressed in time-space that cannot be touched during incarnation. Patterns of fear that persisted across lifetimes can be recognized and released.

Sometimes, for entities who have experienced particularly difficult incarnations, a kind of rest is provided. The entity may be surrounded by an atmosphere that recalls the happiest moments of the previous life.

Once healing and review are sufficiently complete, attention turns to what comes next. For entities who have not yet graduated from third density, this typically means another incarnation.

Entities who have developed sufficient awareness participate actively in planning their next life. They choose their parents, not for comfort or ease but for the learning opportunities those parents will provide. They select the circumstances of birth, the culture, the era, the challenges.

Approximately half of those currently incarnating on your planet make these choices consciously. The remaining portion are guided by beings who serve as helpers in the incarnation process.

When you grasp that your circumstances were chosen, that your parents, your challenges, your very limitations were selected for purposes of learning, everything changes. The difficult childhood becomes not a random misfortune but a chosen curriculum.

This is not to suggest that all suffering should be passively accepted. The choice of circumstances does not predetermine responses. But it does reframe the fundamental relationship to experience.

With the total freedom to choose one's incarnative circumstances comes a particular temptation. Some entities, eager for growth, attempt to learn too much in a single lifetime. They program catalysts so intense that the incarnation becomes overwhelming.

We call this overprogramming, and it carries risk. The incarnation may become so difficult that the entity cannot effectively learn from it.

Your peoples' understanding of what is sometimes called karma is largely in error. Many conceptualize it as a system of punishment or as an inescapable fate determined by past actions. The reality is both simpler and more hopeful.

Karma is simply unbalanced energy. When an entity acts in ways that create imbalance, whether toward others or within itself, that imbalance seeks resolution. The resolution is not imposed by external judgment. It arises from the nature of consciousness itself, which moves always toward balance and unity.

The mechanism is love. Love gives each moment the potential for becoming unbounded. For the entity which has developed sufficient consciousness, any moment can be a releasing moment in which the karma is balanced.

No entity navigates the journey between lives alone. There are guides and helpers, beings who specialize in assisting during this transition.

For entities who incarnate automatically, there are beings directly under the Guardians who take responsibility for incarnation patterns. You may call these beings angelic if you prefer.

For entities with greater development, the Higher Self takes a more active role. This being, which is you at a future stage of development, offers guidance and assistance in the planning process.

These same guides and helpers remain available during incarnation, though the veil obscures awareness of them. The sudden intuition, the dream that carries a message, the synchronicity that seems too meaningful to be coincidence, these may be touches from those who guide.

A question naturally arises: if we plan our incarnations, if we have guides and helpers, why do we remember none of this?

The forgetting is not accident or error. It is the very mechanism that makes third density function as intended. Without forgetting, without the veil of separation, the choices of third density would lose their power.

The veil creates the conditions for authentic decision. In the darkness of unknowing, dependent upon faith rather than sight, the entity must choose how to love. This choice, made without certainty, carries a weight that cannot be replicated in later densities.

When the forgetting has occurred, all experiences become exponentially more powerful. The pain is more painful. The joy is more joyous. The love is more poignant for its fragility and uncertainty.

Death, then, is not an ending but a doorway. The consciousness that you are continues, reviewing what has passed, healing what needs healing, preparing for what comes next. The self persists, grows, evolves across incarnations that may span thousands of your years.

This perspective does not diminish the present. If anything, it enhances it. Each moment in incarnation carries weight precisely because it contributes to this larger journey. The choices made here, in the density of forgetting, shape what you are becoming.

The journey continues. Through death and beyond it, through planning and forgetting, through learning and healing, the spark of consciousness that is you moves ever forward, toward the light it came from, toward the unity it will one day remember, toward the love that awaits at every threshold and on every side.
