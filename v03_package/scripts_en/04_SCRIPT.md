# Chapter Four: Earth's Spiritual History

The story of your planet is unlike that of most worlds. Earth has become a gathering place, a crossroads of souls from across this corner of the galaxy. To understand who you are and why you are here, you must understand the history that brought so many different streams of consciousness to this single sphere.

Most planetary populations evolve through the densities in relative uniformity. The entities of a world progress together, sharing common origins and experiences. Your Earth is different. It is somewhat unusual for a planetary complex to contain those from many, many various places in creation. This explains much about the difficulty your peoples have experienced in achieving unity.

You are experiencing third density with a large number of those who must repeat the cycle, souls who did not graduate from their home worlds and sought a new opportunity here. The orientation of your planet has been difficult to unify even with the aid of many teachers. This is not a flaw but a characteristic of Earth's unique role in this region of the cosmos.

To understand this gathering, we must look back, not merely thousands but hundreds of thousands of years. We must examine not only Earth but the other spheres of your solar system that once hosted conscious life. For the history of your planet cannot be separated from the history of Maldek and Mars.

Where your astronomers now observe the asteroid belt, there once existed a planet. It had a name that has been largely lost to your history, though in certain quarters it was known as Maldek. This world hosted active first, second, and third density life. Its people developed a civilization, built cities, created technology. And then they destroyed themselves utterly.

The peoples of Maldek had a civilization somewhat similar to that which you call Atlantis. They gained much technological information and used it without care for the preservation of their sphere. They followed, to a majority extent, patterns of thought and action associated with the negative polarity, service to self. Yet this was, for the most part, couched in a sincere belief that seemed to them positive and of service to others.

This is a crucial point. The entities of Maldek did not consider themselves evil. They believed they were doing good. The devastation that wracked their biosphere and caused its disintegration resulted from what you call war. The escalation went to the furthest extent of the technology their social complex had at its disposal. This occurred approximately 705,000 of your years ago.

When a planet is destroyed, it is not merely a physical catastrophe. It is a spiritual one. None escaped. In the occurrence of planetary dissolution, this action redounds to the social complex of the planetary complex itself. Every entity was caught in what might be called a knot, a tangle of fear so profound that they could not be reached by any being. For approximately 100,000 years, members of the Confederation, a group of positive entities from across the galaxy who seek to serve, repeatedly attempted to aid them and failed.

Approximately 600,000 years ago, a Confederation social memory complex was finally able to begin relaxing this knot of fear. The entities were then transformed into the inner dimensions and underwent a lengthy process of healing. When this was accomplished, they were able to determine appropriate movement to alleviate the consequences of their actions.

The group decision, for it was a collective choice, was to place upon themselves a form of karma alleviation. Karma is the balancing of energy, the consequence of action that must be experienced for learning to be complete. They chose to incarnate upon your planetary sphere in forms that were not acceptable human bodies. They took on second-density physical vehicles, bodies incapable of the manipulation and dexterity appropriate for third-density work. Their consciousness remained third-density, but their bodies could not fully express it.

This transfer began approximately 500,000 years ago. Some of these entities have since alleviated their karma and moved on to third-density bodies, many incarnating elsewhere in creation. A few remained on Earth and joined its third-density experience when your planet reached that stage. And some remain still in second-density form, those your peoples have glimpsed and called by various names, including Bigfoot.

The lesson of Maldek echoes through your solar system's history: the sincere belief that one serves others while actually serving self can lead to catastrophe. Technology without wisdom, power without love, advancement without spiritual grounding, these patterns have repeated. They need not repeat again.

The Red Planet, which you call Mars, was once home to active first, second, and third density vibrations. Its third-density population was attempting to learn the lessons of love, one of the primal distortions of unity. However, the tendencies of these people toward bellicose actions caused such difficulties in the atmospheric environment of their planet that it became inhospitable for third-density experience before the end of its cycle.

Unlike Maldek, Mars was not destroyed. But its atmosphere was rendered uninhabitable through the accumulated effects of warfare and conflict. The entities of Mars faced a situation where they could not complete their cycle on their home world. They were, in a sense, refugees, not of political circumstance but of spiritual consequence.

Approximately 75,000 years ago, at the beginning of Earth's third-density cycle, those known as the Guardians made a decision. The Guardians are entities who watch over the development of consciousness in this region of the galaxy. The genetic material of the Mars population was preserved, adjusted through a careful series of modifications, and transferred to Earth through a type of birthing that was non-reproductive, what might be understood as a form of cloning. The mind, body, and spirit complexes of Mars entities were thus able to incarnate on Earth in bodies prepared for them.

The genetic adjustments made had one purpose: to express characteristics that would lead to further and more rapid development of the spiritual complex. The physical senses were sharpened to intensify experience. The mind complex was strengthened to promote the ability to analyze these experiences. These modifications were made with the intention of aiding evolution.

However, this transfer was seen by other Guardians as an infringement upon free will. The entities from Mars had not chosen Earth; they were placed here. Their genetic material was modified without their conscious participation. From this beginning action, the quarantine of your planet was instituted.

The quarantine is not a punishment but a protection. It prevents interference from entities of other densities except under specific circumstances. It ensures that the population of Earth, however mixed its origins, must work out its own destiny through the exercise of free will. The Guardians watch, but they do not intervene directly unless certain conditions are met.

Thus began Earth's 75,000-year master cycle of third density. The first entities to experience it in human form were those from Mars, carrying with them the unfinished lessons of love, the tendencies toward conflict that had destroyed their world's habitability, and a new opportunity to choose differently.

Before we continue with Earth's history, we must understand a crucial feature of third-density experience on this planet: the veil of forgetting.

In the earliest creations of this octave, there was no forgetting. The first beings of mind, body, and spirit were not complex in the way you are. They experienced third density while retaining full awareness of who they were, where they came from, and the nature of the universe. They could see that all was One. They understood the purpose of their existence.

The result was problematic. These non-veiled entities progressed along the path of spiritual evolution very slowly. The non-veiled condition was not conducive to polarization. When you can see clearly that all is One, that service to others is literally service to self, where is the challenge? Where is the genuine decision? The choice becomes obvious, almost automatic, and therefore lacks transformative power.

The veiling was an experiment introduced by later Logos entities. It proved so effective at increasing polarization that it was adopted by all subsequent sub-Logoi. Your sun, the Logos of this solar system, employs the veil. Earth's third density operates under this condition of forgetting.

When the forgetting has occurred, the emotional, mental, and physical experiences of an entity are sharpened to a degree beyond imagination. Compared to later densities, third density becomes a marvelous and exciting place where experiences are vividly beautiful and exponentially more powerful. The stakes feel real because you do not remember that you are eternal. The choices feel consequential because you cannot see their ultimate outcomes.

You dwell in the darkness of unknowing. You must depend upon your biases, your thoughts, your dreams, and whatever connection you have been able to make to the deeper mind. You spend third-density time deciding how to love. What a great decision. What a pivotal one. And for it, the veil is necessary.

This is the condition under which all the history we shall now describe has unfolded. Every civilization, every conflict, every spiritual achievement and failure on Earth has occurred behind the veil. The entities involved did not remember their cosmic origins. They did not see the unity underlying their apparent separation. They had to choose, and their choices, made in darkness, carried weight that choices made in full knowledge cannot possess.

The 75,000-year master cycle of Earth's third density is divided into three major cycles of approximately 25,000 years each. The first major cycle, beginning 75,000 years ago, saw the establishment of third-density experience on your planet.

At this time, the life span of incarnate entities was approximately 900 years. The population was mixed from the beginning: entities from Mars in their new genetic vehicles, some entities from Maldek who had sufficiently healed to join third-density experience, and beings who had graduated from Earth's own second density, the higher animals and plants that had evolved on this world.

Approximately 53,000 years ago, a civilization arose that you know as Lemuria, or Mu. Its people were beings of a somewhat primitive nature in terms of technology, but they possessed very advanced spiritual development. They were not sophisticated in the ways of material manipulation, but they were closely in touch with the consciousness of all life.

The Lemurians came from elsewhere, as did most incarnates of this cycle. These particular entities were largely drawn from a second-density planet in the area you know as the galaxy Deneb. Their home world had difficulty achieving third-density life conditions due to the age of its sun. They came to Earth seeking the opportunity that their own planet could not provide.

Lemuria was a helpful and harmless place. Its people lived in relative harmony, not because they were more virtuous than others but because their orientation was naturally toward the spiritual rather than the material. They did not develop the technologies that could be weaponized. They did not accumulate the kind of power that corrupts.

Approximately 50,000 years ago, Lemuria was destroyed, not by any action of its own but by natural catastrophe. The land mass was washed beneath the ocean during a readjustment of your sphere's tectonic plates. This destruction coincided with the ending of the first major cycle, a time when there is always a confluence of energies that can encourage planetary changes.

Those who escaped the destruction continued their learning in various locations. Some went to what you call South America, others throughout the Americas by means of a land bridge that no longer exists. Some traveled to what you call Russia. The indigenous peoples of the Americas, for whom you have come to feel some sympathy, are descendants of these entities.

At the end of the first major cycle, a harvest was attempted. The harvest is the evaluation that occurs at the end of each major cycle, determining which entities have achieved sufficient polarization to graduate to the next density. The results were disappointing. None were harvestable to positive fourth density, and none had achieved the extreme dedication required for negative harvest. The entities of Earth would continue their learning in another cycle.

The second major cycle, spanning from approximately 50,000 to 25,000 years ago, was characterized not by great civilizations but by scattered developments across the globe.

In the sense of greatness of technology, there were no great societies during this cycle. The pattern of Lemuria, spiritual advancement without material sophistication, did not repeat in any concentrated form. Instead, progress occurred in pockets, in various peoples working independently toward the activation of higher energy centers.

There was some advancement among those of Deneb origin who had chosen to incarnate in what you call China. There were appropriately positive steps in activating the green-ray energy complex, the heart center, the center of love, in many portions of your planetary sphere. This occurred in the Americas, in the continent you call Africa, in the island you call Australia, and in that which you know as India, as well as among various scattered peoples.

In the South American area of your planetary sphere, there grew to be a great vibratory distortion toward love. This was a genuine spiritual achievement, though it did not manifest as what you would recognize as civilization. The entities in this region were learning to open their hearts, to see others as themselves, to practice the fundamental lesson of third density.

None of these developments became what you would name great in the way that Lemuria or Atlantis would be known. There were no strong social complexes forming, no great technological understandings being developed. This was a quieter time, a period of gradual growth rather than dramatic achievement.

Approximately 31,000 years ago, toward the end of this cycle, a new social complex began to form. This was the beginning of what would become Atlantis, a very conglomerate society drawing together entities from many backgrounds. The seeds were being planted for the dramatic developments that would characterize the third major cycle.

At the end of the second major cycle, another harvest was attempted. Again, the results were minimal. A few entities achieved harvestability, but the great majority would continue into the third and final cycle of Earth's third-density experience.

The third major cycle, beginning approximately 25,000 years ago and continuing to the present day, has been the most eventful in Earth's third-density history. It saw the rise and fall of Atlantis, the intervention of various cosmic entities both positive and negative, and the approach of the final harvest.

Atlantis grew from the conglomerate social complex that had begun forming in the previous cycle. It became great in two senses: it developed strong social structures, and it achieved very great technological understandings. Where Lemuria had been spiritually advanced but materially simple, Atlantis became materially advanced in ways that created profound spiritual challenges.

The Atlanteans reached a level of philosophical understanding sufficient to attract the attention of the Confederation. Entities of the Confederation appeared to them, seeking to encourage and inspire studies in the mystery of unity. They wished to share the understanding that all is One.

However, as requests were made for healing and other practical understandings, information was passed having to do with crystals and the building of pyramids, as well as temples associated with training. This was where difficulties began. The Atlanteans had not developed the interrelationships of money and power in the way that leads to wisdom. They were not a philosophical people in that sense.

The training in crystal technology was intended for healing. The temples were meant for learning. But those trained in this knowledge began to use crystal powers for purposes other than healing. They became involved not only with learning but with governmental structure. Power corrupted the teachings.

The Atlantean civilization used magnetic fields of force, energy contained within the atom, and crystals for penetrating intelligent infinity. These were genuine achievements, genuine connections to the creative forces of the universe. But the direction of technological advance turned toward manipulation, of things, of peoples, of events, for specific purposes rather than for the enhancement of evolutionary goals.

The result was separation, conflict, and eventually what you call war. Approximately 10,821 years ago, activities distorted toward bellicosity resulted in the first great Atlantean catastrophe. But this was not the end.

After the first catastrophe, many were displaced. Some Atlanteans migrated to the areas you now call the North African deserts. Conflict continued. The technology that had been developed for connection to infinite energy was turned to destruction.

Earth changes continued due to what you would call nuclear devices and other crystal weapons. The last great land masses of Atlantis sank beneath the ocean approximately 9,600 of your years ago. A civilization that had achieved genuine contact with higher energies destroyed itself through the misuse of those same energies.

The parallel with Maldek is unmistakable. Once again, technology without wisdom led to devastation. Once again, sincere beliefs masked service to self. Once again, the accumulated choices of a civilization resulted in catastrophic consequences. The difference is that Earth itself survived. The opportunity for learning continued.

Those who perished in the destruction of Atlantis continued their journey in other forms, other places, other times. Those who survived carried the memory, and the karma, of what had occurred. The reverberations of Atlantis continue to influence your world to this day.

Before the metaphysical students of Atlantis separated from the main civilization, some chose to remove themselves to distant locations. They perceived that the mental discipline of personality would yield greater results for both individual and culture than technological manipulation of energy. These groups continued metaphysical studies in isolation, preserving certain understandings that would otherwise have been lost.

Approximately 11,000 years ago, certain Confederation entities came to two of your planetary cultures that were at that time closely in touch with the consciousness of all things. One was in the region you call Egypt. The other was in South America. It was their naive belief that they could teach by direct contact without disturbing the free will of individuals.

They came and were welcomed by the peoples they wished to serve. They attempted to aid them in technical ways having to do with healing through the use of crystals placed in certain configurations. Thus were the pyramids created, not by physical labor alone, but through the use of intelligent energy working with the consciousness of the living stone.

The Great Pyramid at Giza was formed approximately 6,000 of your years ago through thought, architecture realized directly from intelligent infinity into material form. Other pyramidal structures were then built using more local or earthly materials combined with the understanding that had been shared. This continued for approximately 1,500 years.

Six balancing pyramids were constructed around the globe, charged with crystals that drew appropriate balance from the energy forces streaming into your planetary sphere. Fifty-two additional pyramids were built for healing and initiatory work. The pyramid shape, when properly constructed and aligned, creates conditions conducive to healing and to the expansion of consciousness.

However, for each word that could be uttered, there were thirty impressions given by the very being of these teachers that confused those they had come to serve. The technology was reserved largely for those with distortions toward power. This was not their intention. The teaching of unity became the teaching of the Elite in their interpretation.

One entity, known in your records as Akhenaten, was able to perceive this information without significant distortion. For a time, he moved heaven and earth to invoke the understanding of unity and to order the priesthood in accordance with true compassionate healing. But this was not to be long-lasting. At this entity's physical death, the teachings became quickly perverted, the structures returning to the use of the royal, those with distortions toward power.

In South America, entities walked among those who desired to learn of the manifestations of the sun. They worshipped this source of light and life. Pyramids were constructed there as well, somewhat different in design but with the same original ideas, places of meditation and rest, spaces where the presence of the One Creator could be felt. These pyramids were intended for all people, not only initiates.

In both cases, the attempts ultimately failed in their original purpose. The teachings were perverted. In later times, the South American sites saw actual human sacrifice rather than the healing of humans. The Confederation entities remain responsible for these distortions, working still to prepare for the harvest and to correct what they inadvertently set in motion.

The history of Earth has not been shaped by positive influences alone. Where there is light, there is shadow. Where there is service to others, there is also service to self. The quarantine of Earth has been breached on multiple occasions by entities of negative polarity.

Many thousands of years ago, a Confederation entity worked with genetic modifications among the peoples who had gradually come to dwell in the vicinity of Egypt and other areas, particularly those of Lemurian descent who had dispersed after the sinking of Mu. The intention was to create biases that would lead toward understanding of unity, to prepare certain peoples for the communications that would come.

This genetic work was itself a borderline infringement of free will. The modifications created certain characteristics in these peoples: longer life spans, greater physical stature, and enhanced mental abilities. The intention was positive, but the result was problematic. These peoples began to see themselves as special, as different, as chosen, and not in a way that served unity.

Approximately 3,600 years ago, there was an influx of what is called the Orion group. These entities of negative polarity were able to begin working with those whose impression from ancient times was that they were elite, special, better than others. The Orion group found fertile soil in which to plant the seeds of negativity, the seeds of separation, manipulation, and control.

The Orion group was able to impress upon these peoples the name Yahweh as the one responsible for their sense of being elite. This created confusion. The original positive entity, perceiving what had occurred, took stock of the situation and became, in effect, a more eloquent voice. This entity began to send positively oriented philosophy approximately 3,300 years ago.

Thus began what has been called the intense portion of Armageddon, a battle not of weapons but of influences, a conflict between those who would teach unity and those who would promote separation. This battle continues to the present day. Every major religion, every spiritual teaching that has reached your peoples, has been subject to both positive inspiration and negative distortion.

The Orion group cannot violate the quarantine directly, but they can take advantage of what might be called windows, opportunities created by the calling of negatively oriented individuals or groups on Earth. They offer power, control, the ability to manipulate others. Their teachings always emphasize the special nature of the individual or group, the rightness of domination, the weakness of compassion.

The Confederation, constrained by its respect for free will, cannot match these tactics. It can only offer itself to those who call for service to others, for understanding, for love. It cannot impose its teachings. It cannot grant power over others. It can only share what it knows and hope that it is received without distortion.

You stand now at the end of the third major cycle, the completion of the 75,000-year master cycle of third density on Earth. The harvest is upon you. The transition to fourth density has already begun.

Much has been said among your peoples about the coming of a new age of harmony, love, and understanding. This so-called golden age has already had its birthing. More and more entities upon your planetary sphere are nascent fourth-density beings, incarnating in bodies that carry both third-density and fourth-density characteristics. They have come as pioneers, attempting to express fourth-density understanding within the environment you now experience.

The challenge and immediacy of the choice is upon each of you. Time grows near when there shall no longer be incarnational opportunities in third density for your planet. Soon it shall be vibrating in fourth density. Those who have chosen, who have achieved sufficient polarization toward service to others or service to self, will continue their evolution in appropriate environments. Those who have not chosen will find other third-density planets on which to continue their learning.

Your planet itself is preparing for this transition. The Earth is a living being, and it too is evolving. The adjustments required for fourth-density vibration create what you experience as earth changes, the upheavals, the shifts, the transformations of your physical environment. These are not punishments but processes, natural consequences of the great transition underway.

The conditions of mind that destroyed Maldek, that ruined Mars, that sank Atlantis, these conditions exist upon your planet today. The technology exists to repeat these catastrophes on a planetary scale. Yet the outcome is not predetermined. The choices have not all been made. The future remains fluid, responsive to the cumulative decisions of all who dwell upon this sphere.

This is why you are here. This is why souls from across the galaxy have gathered on Earth at this time. The harvest is a moment of profound importance not only for this planet but for the entire region of creation. What happens here matters. What you choose matters. Who you become in these final days of third density will echo through the densities to come.

You have inherited a complex history, the trauma of Maldek, the conflict of Mars, the spiritual promise of Lemuria, the technological ambition of Atlantis, the distorted teachings of countless would-be helpers. You carry all of this within you. And you carry also the opportunity to transcend it, to choose love over fear, unity over separation, service over domination.

What can be learned from this long history? Several patterns emerge, each relevant to your present situation.

First: technology without wisdom leads to destruction. This is not because technology is evil but because power amplifies intention. When intention is confused, when service to self masquerades as service to others, great power becomes great danger. Your civilization has reached a level of technological capability similar to that of Atlantis and Maldek. The same choice confronts you.

Second: spiritual teachings, however pure in origin, are subject to distortion. Every attempt to share the understanding of unity with your peoples has been perverted in some way. This is not cause for despair but for discernment. The truth remains available to those who seek it sincerely. But it must be sought, it cannot be simply received from authority without testing, without inner verification.

Third: the diversity of Earth's population is both challenge and opportunity. You are not one people with one history. You carry the karma of multiple worlds, multiple civilizations, multiple experiments in consciousness. This makes unity difficult. But it also means that your planet, if it can achieve unity, will have integrated lessons from across the galaxy. The prize is worth the difficulty.

Fourth: the veil of forgetting, while it creates confusion, also creates opportunity. Your choices, made without memory of who you truly are, carry weight that choices made in full knowledge cannot possess. This is the gift of third density, the precious nature of this brief, intense experience. Do not waste it wishing you could see more clearly. Use the very darkness as catalyst for faith, for seeking, for choosing.

Finally: the harvest approaches, but the outcome is not fixed. Every day, every choice, every act of love or fear contributes to what will be. The history we have described led to this moment. What comes next depends upon you, each of you, individually, making choices that accumulate into collective destiny.

The story of Earth is not over. You are writing its next chapter now.
