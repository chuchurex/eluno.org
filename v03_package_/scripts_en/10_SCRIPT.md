# Chapter Ten: The Energy Centers

Within you exists a system of profound elegance. Seven centers of energy, arranged along the axis of your being, receive and process the light that animates all existence. These energy centers, sometimes called rays or chakras in various traditions, are not merely symbols or metaphors. They are the actual mechanisms through which consciousness interfaces with the physical vehicle and through which spiritual evolution occurs.

Understanding these centers offers the seeker something invaluable: a map of the inner landscape. When you know how energy flows through you, when you can recognize where it moves freely and where it meets obstruction, you gain the ability to work consciously with your own evolution.

Each center corresponds to a color of the spectrum, a density of consciousness, and a body within your complex of bodies. Each has its proper function, its characteristic blockages, and its unique gifts when open and balanced. Together they form an instrument through which the Creator may know Itself in yet another unique configuration.

The origin of all energy is the action of free will upon Love. The nature of all energy is Light. This light enters your being through two pathways. The first is the inner light, the Polaris of the self, the guiding star that is your birthright and true nature.

The second pathway brings light from without. If you imagine the physical body as a magnetic field, this energy enters from the south, through the feet, through the base of the spine, rising upward through the body. This universal light energy is undifferentiated when it enters. It becomes colored, shaped, and defined as it passes through each energy center.

Picture the energy centers as a series of lenses through which light must pass. Where a lens is clear, light moves through unimpeded. Where a lens is clouded or blocked, light is diminished or stopped entirely. The quality of light that reaches your higher centers depends entirely upon the condition of the centers below.

The violet ray, at the crown, serves as a thermometer or indicator of the whole system. It cannot be manipulated directly. It simply reflects the sum total of all that you are.

The first three energy centers deal with the foundational aspects of incarnate existence. They must be reasonably clear and balanced before significant work can occur in the higher centers.

The red-ray center is the foundation of all else. Located at the base of the spine, it deals with survival, physical existence, and the most basic expressions of sexuality. This center is always somewhat active in any incarnate being. Understanding and accepting this energy is fundamental. The body's needs for food, rest, safety, and physical expression are not obstacles to spirituality; they are the foundation of incarnate spirituality.

The orange-ray center, in the lower abdomen, governs personal identity and one-to-one relationships. When this center is blocked, the distortion often manifests as difficulty accepting oneself, personal eccentricities, self-rejection, or confusion about one's own nature.

The yellow-ray center, at the solar plexus, deals with the ego, personal power, and social relationships. Here the individual encounters the group: family, community, society. Blockages in this center manifest as distortions toward power manipulation, struggles for dominance, or difficulty finding one's place within the social order.

These three centers form what might be called the personality. They deal with the self as individual, the self in intimate relationship, and the self in society. Until they function with reasonable clarity, the seeker cannot effectively access the higher centers.

The green-ray center is the heart of the system in every sense. Located in the center of the chest, it is the center from which third-density beings may springboard toward infinite intelligence. It is the great transitional ray, the bridge between the personal and the universal.

Green ray is the ray of universal love, not personal affection for particular beings, but the ability to see all beings as other-selves, as the Creator in another form. When this center opens, the entity begins to perceive the unity that underlies all apparent separation.

The activation of the green-ray center marks a crucial threshold in third-density development. Once this center is activated, the entity's incarnations cease to be automatic. It begins to participate consciously in planning its experiences.

The green ray is also the first center through which genuine energy transfer between beings can occur. In the lower centers, energy exchanges tend to be extractive or manipulative. In green ray, both entities are strengthened.

The three higher centers, blue, indigo, and violet, deal with aspects of being that transcend the personal. They are available to the third-density entity, but skill and discipline are needed to access them effectively.

The blue-ray center, at the throat, is the first center that radiates outward as well as receiving inward. It governs communication, not merely speaking, but the honest expression of the self to the self and to others. Blue ray requires something your peoples possess in great scarcity: honesty.

The indigo-ray center, sometimes called the third eye, is the gateway to intelligent infinity. This is the center worked upon by the adept. Through this center, contact may be made with intelligent energy. The most common blockage in the indigo center manifests as a sense of unworthiness.

The violet-ray center, at the crown, cannot be worked upon directly. It is simply the total expression of the entity's vibratory complex, the sum of everything else. In harvest, it is this ray that is manifested to gauge the entity's readiness.

A blockage is not a wall but a distortion, a clouding of the lens through which energy must pass. Every entity has blockages of some kind. Understanding the nature of blockages allows the seeker to work with them more skillfully.

The first step in working with blockages is simply recognition. The seeker learns to notice where energy flows freely and where it meets resistance. This requires honest self-observation.

The second step is acceptance. This may seem paradoxical, how can accepting a blockage help release it? Yet resistance to a blockage often strengthens it. Acceptance does not mean approval. It means acknowledging what is.

The third step is intention. With recognition and acceptance established, the seeker may direct conscious will toward greater balance. This is not forcing. It is inviting.

As the energy centers become unblocked, they begin to spin. This rotation indicates the free flow of energy through the center. In the higher centers, something different occurs. As these centers develop, they begin to form crystalline structures, regular, faceted configurations of energy that are unique to each entity.

The pattern of energy-center activation differs fundamentally between those who choose the positive path and those who choose the negative.

In the positively oriented entity, the configuration is even and crystalline across all seven rays. Energy flows smoothly from red through violet, with each center contributing its unique quality. The heart center serves as the hub from which the higher work proceeds.

The negatively oriented entity follows a different pattern. Energy moves through red, orange, and yellow, then bypasses the green ray entirely, moving directly to indigo. The negative path seeks contact with intelligent infinity without the intermediary of universal love.

This is possible. It is evolutionarily functional through fifth density. But it is extremely difficult. Opening the gateway to intelligent infinity from the solar plexus requires tremendous stamina and energy in the lower rays.

The energy that moves through sexual expression can operate through any of the centers. Understanding this allows the seeker to approach sexuality not as obstacle or indulgence but as potential vehicle for spiritual work.

At the red-ray level, sexuality is purely reproductive. At the orange and yellow levels, sexuality becomes personal but often distorted.

In green-ray sexual transfer, something entirely different occurs. When both entities vibrate at this level, there is mutually strengthening energy exchange. Both are polarized. Both release excess energy that each has in abundance by nature.

Blue-ray sexual transfer is rare among your peoples but offers great aid. It involves the complete expression of self without reservation or fear.

Indigo-ray sexual transfer approaches the sacramental. Here, contact may be made through violet ray with intelligent infinity itself. This is the sacred marriage of which mystics speak.

There are practices through which the seeker may work directly with the energy centers. Find a time of quiet. Seat yourself comfortably. Allow the concerns of the day to settle.

Turn your attention to the base of your spine. Visualize there a sphere of red light. Observe its condition. Is it bright or dim? Clear or muddy? Do not judge what you see. Simply observe. Then, gently, invite this center to brighten.

Move upward to the lower abdomen and its orange light. Continue to the solar plexus and its yellow fire. At the heart center, take particular care. This green light is crucial to all that follows. Continue through the throat's blue light, through the indigo light between the brows, finally to the violet light at the crown.

You may seal this work by visualizing the violet and red lights mixing, forming a protective sheath around your entire being. This practice, done regularly, creates the conditions for gradual clearing and balancing of the entire energy system.

The energy centers are not abstract concepts but living realities within you, operating in this moment as in every moment. You are an instrument through which the Creator experiences and knows Itself. The quality of that experience depends significantly upon the condition of this instrument.

Begin where you are. Notice what you notice. Accept what you find. Invite greater balance with patience and persistence. The centers respond to attention. They respond to love.

The catalyst you encounter each day, the experiences that challenge and confuse and delight, these are the materials through which the energy centers are worked. Understanding the centers is only the beginning. Using them skillfully in the midst of living experience is the ongoing practice of the incarnation.
