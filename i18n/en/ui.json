      "This book presents teachings that are not mine. They were received by Don, Carla, and Jim between 1981 and 1984. My only contribution has been to remove barriers that made access difficult, and to build bridges between this material and other spiritual traditions. I did not do this alone: Claude, an artificial intelligence created by Anthropic, helped me find words I had searched for over years.",
      "What follows belongs to all seekers. Take what resonates. Leave what does not. The teachings ask nothing more."
