        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "The story of your planet is unlike that of most worlds. Earth has become a gathering place, a crossroads of souls from across this corner of the galaxy. To understand who you are and why you are here, you must understand the history that brought so many different streams of consciousness to this single sphere."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Most planetary populations evolve through the {term:densities} in relative uniformity. The entities of a world progress together, sharing common origins and experiences. Your Earth is different. It is somewhat unusual for a planetary complex to contain those from many, many various places in creation. This explains much about the difficulty your peoples have experienced in achieving unity."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "You are experiencing third density with a large number of those who must repeat the cycle, souls who did not graduate from their home worlds and sought a new opportunity here. The orientation of your planet has been difficult to unify even with the aid of many teachers. This is not a flaw but a characteristic of Earth's unique role in this region of the cosmos."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "To understand this gathering, we must look back, not merely thousands but hundreds of thousands of years. We must examine not only Earth but the other spheres of your solar system that once hosted conscious life. For the history of your planet cannot be separated from the history of {term:maldek} and {term:mars}."}

      "content": [
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Where your astronomers now observe the asteroid belt, there once existed a planet. {ref:astro:asteroid-belt} It had a name that has been largely lost to your history, though in certain quarters it was known as Maldek. This world hosted active first, second, and third density life. Its people developed a civilization, built cities, created technology. And then they destroyed themselves utterly."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "The peoples of Maldek had a civilization somewhat similar to that which you call {ref:myth:plato-atlantis}. They gained much technological information and used it without care for the preservation of their sphere. They followed, to a majority extent, patterns of thought and action associated with the negative polarity, {term:service-to-self}. Yet this was, for the most part, couched in a sincere belief that seemed to them positive and of service to others."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "This is a crucial point. The entities of Maldek did not consider themselves evil. They believed they were doing good. The devastation that wracked their biosphere and caused its disintegration resulted from what you call war. The escalation went to the furthest extent of the technology their social complex had at its disposal. This occurred approximately 705,000 of your years ago."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "When a planet is destroyed, it is not merely a physical catastrophe. It is a spiritual one. None escaped. Every entity was caught in what might be called a knot, a tangle of fear so profound that they could not be reached by any being. For approximately 100,000 years, members of the {term:confederation} repeatedly attempted to aid them and failed."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Approximately 600,000 years ago, a Confederation {term:social-memory-complex} was finally able to begin relaxing this knot of fear. The entities were then transformed into the inner dimensions and underwent a lengthy process of healing."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "The group decision was to place upon themselves a form of {term:karma} alleviation. {ref:trad:hinduism-karma} They chose to incarnate upon your planetary sphere in forms that were not acceptable human bodies. This transfer began approximately 500,000 years ago."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "The lesson of Maldek echoes through your solar system's history: the sincere belief that one serves others while actually serving self can lead to catastrophe. {ref:phil:technology-ethics} without wisdom, power without love, advancement without spiritual grounding, these patterns have repeated. They need not repeat again."}

      "content": [
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "The Red Planet, which you call Mars, was once home to active first, second, and third density vibrations. Its third-density population was attempting to learn the lessons of {term:love}. However, the tendencies of these people toward bellicose actions caused such difficulties in the atmospheric environment of their planet that it became inhospitable for third-density experience before the end of its cycle."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Approximately 75,000 years ago, at the beginning of Earth's third-density cycle, those known as the {term:guardians} made a decision. The genetic material of the Mars population was preserved and transferred to Earth. The {term:mind-body-spirit} complexes of Mars entities were thus able to incarnate on Earth in bodies prepared for them."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "However, this transfer was seen by other Guardians as an infringement upon {term:free-will}. From this beginning action, the {term:quarantine} of your planet was instituted."},

        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "Thus began Earth's 75,000-year {term:master-cycle} of third density. The first entities to experience it in human form were those from Mars, carrying with them the unfinished lessons of love and a new opportunity to choose differently."}

        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "In the earliest creations of this {term:octave}, there was no forgetting. The first beings experienced third density while retaining full awareness of who they were. The result was problematic. These non-veiled entities progressed very slowly."},
        {"type": "paragraph", "text": "The veiling was an experiment introduced by later {term:logos} entities. It proved so effective at increasing {term:polarity} that it was adopted by all subsequent {term:sub-logos}. Your sun employs the veil. Earth's third density operates under this condition of forgetting."},

Information was passed having to do with crystals and pyramids. But those trained began to use crystal powers for purposes other than healing. Power corrupted the teachings."},
