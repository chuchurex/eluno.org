Let it become not just an occasional impulse but a consistent way of being. The 51 percent threshold is not about perfection. It is about genuine intention persistently applied. It is about sincerity more than achievement."

The densities stretching ahead, the millions of years of evolution, the vast processes of harvest and transition—these can seem too large to comprehend. But your part is simple.

Each day in third density is a gift. Each difficulty is catalyst that can be used. Each relationship is opportunity for service. Use what you have been given. The One Infinite Creator experiences itself through your choices. Make them count."
