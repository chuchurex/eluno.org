You know him, for he dwells with you and will be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I will come to you.\"</em>"

The God of the universe would make his dwelling in the human heart. Paul says it plainly: <em>\"Do you not know that you are God's temple and that God's Spirit dwells in you?\"</em>"

We have the Master himself living within us, guiding us, transforming us, giving us power to be what we could never be on our own."

          "text": "The Holy Spirit fulfills many roles in the believer's life. Jesus said that he <em>\"will teach you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I have said to you.\"</em> There are moments when a word of Scripture suddenly comes alive, when a verse you had read a hundred times suddenly penetrates your heart with new force. That is the Spirit teaching, reminding, illuminating."

          "text": "Paul speaks of how <em>\"the Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.\"</em> There is an inner certainty that comes not from reasoning but from something deeper — an assurance in the heart that we belong to the Father, that we are loved, that we are home. That inner testimony is the Spirit's work."

They are fruits that grow naturally when we remain connected to the vine. Jesus said: <em>\"Whoever abides in me and I in him, he it is that bears much fruit, for apart from me you can do nothing.\"</em>"

          "text": "The Christian life is not primarily an effort to be good. It is a relationship. It is abiding in Christ and letting Christ abide in us. It is opening ourselves each day to the Spirit who dwells in us, listening to his gentle voice, following his promptings, allowing his life to flow through ours."

Sometimes as a deep peace in the midst of circumstances that should produce anxiety. Sometimes through the words of a fellow believer, a passage of Scripture, a circumstance that seems to answer exactly what you were asking."

He respects our freedom while drawing us toward true freedom. <em>\"Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom,\"</em> Paul says. Not the freedom to do whatever we want, but the freedom to be who we were created to be."
