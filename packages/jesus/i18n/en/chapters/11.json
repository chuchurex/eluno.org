          "text": "There is a moment in every journey of faith where we must admit: we do not understand everything. And that is okay. God did not ask us to comprehend him completely. He asked us to trust. <em>\"Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding,\"</em> says Proverbs. Mature faith does not demand having all the answers. It rests in the one who has the answers, even if he does not share them all with us."

          "text": "Job learned this the hard way. After chapters of debate, of unanswered questions, of pain that made no sense, God finally spoke. But he did not explain the why of Job's suffering. Instead, he revealed his greatness — the creation of the universe, the wonders of nature, the mysteries Job could not comprehend. And Job responded: <em>\"Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth.\"</em>"

Job did not receive an explanation; he received presence. <em>\"I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you.\"</em>"

          "text": "This does not mean questions are forbidden. The Psalms are full of honest questions, even complaints. <em>\"How long, O Lord? Will you forget me forever?\"</em> cries David. God is not offended by our honesty. He prefers genuine questions to pretended certainties."

We know that nothing can separate us from God's love — neither death nor life, nor angels nor rulers, nor things present nor things to come. The foundations are firm, even if many details remain in mystery."

You have the words of eternal life.\"</em> Not because we have everything figured out, but because we have found someone worthy of our trust — someone who demonstrated his love on the cross and his power in the resurrection."

Every question will find an answer. Every pain will make sense. Until then, we walk by faith — trusting the one who called us, following the one who loved us first, awaiting the day when we will see him as he is."
