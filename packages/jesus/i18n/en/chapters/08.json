He was speaking as one who knows there is something on the other side — something better, something that makes present chains seem light in comparison."

          "text": "Christian hope is not vague optimism or illusion for comfort. It is anchored in a historical event: the resurrection of Jesus. <em>\"But in fact Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep,\"</em> says Paul. If Christ rose, then death does not have the last word. If he conquered the grave, we too will conquer it in him."

          "text": "Jesus himself promised: <em>\"I am the resurrection and the life. Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet shall he live, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die.\"</em> These words he spoke at the tomb of his friend Lazarus, moments before demonstrating his power over death. They were not philosophical theory. They were a declaration of authority."

          "text": "What does this mean for how we live today? It means we can face difficulties with an eternal perspective. Paul puts it this way: <em>\"For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us.\"</em> He does not minimize suffering — Paul knew suffering better than most — but he places it in context."

          "text": "It also means that farewells are not final. <em>\"But we do not want you to be uninformed, brothers, about those who are asleep, that you may not grieve as others do who have no hope.\"</em> Grief is real and necessary. Jesus himself wept at Lazarus's tomb. But Christian grief is tinged with hope. It is not goodbye forever but \"see you later.\""

Everything that sin broke will be healed. Every injustice will be corrected. Every true love will be reunited."

Because we believe in final restoration, we participate in present restoration. We feed the hungry, visit the prisoner, care for the sick — not because we think we will solve all problems, but because this is what the Kingdom looks like, and we want it to be seen now."

It is hope anchored in the character of God — and he is faithful."
