      "The density of self-awareness and choice. The yellow ray. Where humanity currently resides. Duration: approximately 75,000 years per major cycle.",
      "Third density is unique in the octave of creation because it is here, and only here, that the fundamental Choice between polarities is made. The veil of forgetting creates the conditions of uncertainty necessary for this choice to be meaningful.",
      "Graduation from third density requires sufficient polarization: 51% or more orientation toward service to others for positive harvest, or 95% or more orientation toward service to self for negative harvest. Those who do not polarize sufficiently repeat the cycle."

      "Polarization is measured not by individual actions but by the overall orientation of the entity's being. It is the cumulative direction of countless choices, large and small, that determines whether an entity has polarized sufficiently for harvest."
